COMPARING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS IN UNIVERSITY ADMISSION PREDICTION AND APPLYING EXPLAINABLE AI METHODS

This Bachelor's Thesis explores the comparison of multiple Machine Learning models, namely, Linear Regression, SVM, MLP, Random Forest, and 
Bagging Regressor for discovering the best performing algorithm. Additionally, several Explainable AI methods were performed in order to explain
the decisions made by the model at a local and global level. The following architectures were compared: LIME, SHAP and PDP.
